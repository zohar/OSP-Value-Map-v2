## Review

### Problem Summary
The application was failing to start due to a missing CSS import error. The error was:
```
[plugin:vite:css] [postcss] ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '@tweakcn/amber-minimal/dist/index.css'
```

### Root Cause
The `@tweakcn/amber-minimal` package was referenced in `src/index.css` but doesn't exist in the npm registry. It was previously added to `package.json` but the package is not available for installation.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Removed CSS import**: Removed the line `@import '@tweakcn/amber-minimal/dist/index.css';` from `src/index.css`
2. **Package cleanup**: The non-existent package was already removed from `package.json`
3. **Preserved functionality**: All required CSS variables for the amber theme are already defined in the CSS file, so no functionality was lost

### Changes Made
- **src/index.css**: Removed the problematic import on line 2
- **Commit created**: da8a92f with descriptive message

### Security Check
âœ… No security issues identified. The change removes a non-functional import and doesn't introduce any vulnerabilities.

### Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - The CSS import error is fixed and the application should now be able to process the CSS files without errors.

## Node.js Version Compatibility Issue

### Problem Summary
After fixing the CSS import error, a new error appeared:
```
TypeError: crypto.hash is not a function
```

### Root Cause
The issue was caused by Node.js version inconsistency:
- User's system: Node.js v24.3.0 (compatible)
- Development environment: Node.js v20.5.1 (incompatible with Vite 7.0.2)

### Solution Implemented
1. **Added .nvmrc file**: Created `.nvmrc` with `24.3.0` to lock Node.js version
2. **Cleared dependencies**: Removed `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
3. **Reinstalled dependencies**: Ran `npm install` to rebuild with correct Node.js version
4. **Version control**: Committed .nvmrc file for team consistency

### Changes Made
- **/.nvmrc**: Added file specifying Node.js version 24.3.0
- **Commit created**: 8eb27aa with .nvmrc file

### Next Steps
For the user to resolve the crypto.hash error in their terminal:
1. Run `nvm use` (will use version from .nvmrc)
2. Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are built with correct Node.js version
3. Run `npm run dev` to test the application

### Status
ðŸ”„ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED** - .nvmrc file added, but crypto.hash error persists due to terminal session still using old Node.js version. User needs to switch to Node.js v24.3.0 in their terminal.
