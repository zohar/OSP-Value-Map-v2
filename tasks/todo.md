## Review

### Problem Summary
The application was failing to start due to a missing CSS import error. The error was:
```
[plugin:vite:css] [postcss] ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '@tweakcn/amber-minimal/dist/index.css'
```

### Root Cause
The `@tweakcn/amber-minimal` package was referenced in `src/index.css` but doesn't exist in the npm registry. It was previously added to `package.json` but the package is not available for installation.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Removed CSS import**: Removed the line `@import '@tweakcn/amber-minimal/dist/index.css';` from `src/index.css`
2. **Package cleanup**: The non-existent package was already removed from `package.json`
3. **Preserved functionality**: All required CSS variables for the amber theme are already defined in the CSS file, so no functionality was lost

### Changes Made
- **src/index.css**: Removed the problematic import on line 2
- **Commit created**: da8a92f with descriptive message

### Security Check
✅ No security issues identified. The change removes a non-functional import and doesn't introduce any vulnerabilities.

### Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - The CSS import error is fixed and the application should now be able to process the CSS files without errors.
